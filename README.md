### I am developing this project alongisde the Udemy Course "The Complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course", whcih has over 100,000 students.

This project is a demonstration of my understaning -- ability to apply such understanding -- to develop an ASP.NET project with the Model View Controller convention.

It also demonstrates my exerience with:
- Entity Model interaction,
- Bootstrap theme integration and customization,
- RESTful APIs design,
- Fullstack design
- Database schema design

What I have left to complete in the course -- which I am actively taking -- includes: Authentication, Deployment, and Performance Optimization.

You can test this project for yourself by simply cloning the repo, and Building & Running the Solution.
